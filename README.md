# Scholario

A simple web app for all your educational needs!

## Description

A web application designed to streamline interactions between teachers and students. The system automates essential administrative tasks like grade calculations, making educational processes more efficient. Each user has an individual profile: students can sign up for projects, check their grades, and view their average grade across all subjects, while teachers can manage grades and monitor performance across their classes with an integrated scoreboard. The system supports multiple schools, ensuring scalability for larger institutions. Secure login with 2-step verification and role-based access control ensure users access only the features relevant to their role. Non-users can explore schools, view their details, and see their locations on an integrated map. The interface is intuitive, optimized for performance, and offers both light and dark mode for user preference.
